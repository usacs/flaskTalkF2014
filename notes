HTML stands for Hypertext (Markup Language)
HTML should remind you of Microsoft Word.
HTML is the language of the web.

HTML is a client - server interaction. The client is usually a web browser, the server is something like google.com

The HTML code I wrote represents a simple web page.

HTML is not a programming language. It cannot perform Input/Output.

To do input/output, we will use Python - specifically Flask.

Web Server in Flask - Map HTTP Requests to HTTP Responses.
                          ( URL ) -> HTML

Gerlanda's home page here is:
http://localhost:5000/

After clicking submit the page is:
http://localhost:5000/process?order=plain+pizza

We showed how we can write HTML code to show things on webpages.

We showed how we can do simple input/output using Python/Flask

We showed that you can write any Python code (even send a text message) when you're writing a dynamic web site.
