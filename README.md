Flask Talk Fall 2014
==============

This repository contains code, and action items from a Intro to Web Development in Flask talk given on September 29, 2014.

## Code

`cats.html` shows you how to write a simple static web page - something that looks like a Microsoft Word document.

`app.py` shows you how to do input/output on the web. It allows us to accept orders from customers, show them a "thanks for your order" page, and notify someone via text message of the order. You will need to sign up for a Twilio account and fill in your account information in `app.py` to get the text messages to work.

## Takeaways/Action Items

- Writing web code is easier than it looks. I've written less than 150 lines of code that already does something useful.
- I encourage you to think of a simple web application that you'd like to build - you will be far more motivated to work on a project that you find interesting.
- Talk to upperclassmen, mentors or send me an email (vaibhav2614@gmail.com). The CS community is happy to help motivated students, and point you in the right direction.
- It sucks that this stuff - HTML, Python, Flask - isn't taught in our CS classes. Don't use that as an excuse. Remember that you're responsible for your own success.
- Go to [HackRU](http://hackru.org) and build stuff. You'll get inspired by the people and the environment.
- Don't worry about the language, environment you're writing in. People will tell you X is better than Y, and the discussion turns into a religious debate. Learn from the people around you but don't feel compelled to do things exactly like they do.
- As an exception to the previous rule - stop trying to write web apps in Java/Eclipse. Java is generally full of boilerplate, and makes web development harder. I know that you're comfortable in Java because of your coursework, but the initial investment into learning Ruby/Python/Node.js/PHP pays in the long run.

## Resources

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - Teaches you the basics of Python. Good for people new to programming.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - Interesting math-y problems that you can use for code practice in any language. I recommend picking up Python by doing the first ~10 problems if you've already taken 111/112.
- [Flask Docs](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Flask docs. They're pretty well written with code examples, and well written explanations of concepts.
- [CS75.tv](http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/) - A comprehensive dynamic web development course that walks you through HTML/CSS, PHP, Databases, Javascript, Security etc. It gives you a very strong foundation in web development concepts, and it's useful if you prefer a more organized cirriculum.
- Google, StackOverflow, [Rutgers Hackathon Club](http://hackathonclub.com/)

P.S. - I work for [Etsy](http://etsy.com/) - a wonderful software company in Brooklyn. If you're interested in an internship or full time position with us, shoot me an email (vverma@etsy.com).
