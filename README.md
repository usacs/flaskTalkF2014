Flask Talk Fall 2014
==============

This repository contains code, and action items from a Intro to Web Development in Flask talk given on September 29, 2014.

## Code

`cats.html` shows you how to write a simple static web page - something that looks like a Microsoft Word document.

`app.py` shows you how to do input/output on the web. It allows us to accept orders from customers, show them a "thanks for your order" page, and notify someone via text message of the order. You will need to sign up for a Twilio account and fill in your account information in `app.py` to get the text messages to work.

## Takeaways/Action Items

- Writing web code is easier than it looks. I've written less than 150 lines of code that already does something useful.
- I encourage you to think of a simple web application that you'd like to build - you will be far more motivated to work on a project that you find interesting.
- Talk to upperclassmen, mentors or send me an email (vaibhav2614@gmail.com). The CS community is happy to help motivated students, and point you in the right direction.
- It sucks that this stuff - HTML, Python, Flask - isn't taught in our CS classes. Don't use that as an excuse. Remember that you're responsible for your own success.
- Go to [HackRU](http://hackru.org) and build stuff. You'll get inspired by the people and the environment.

P.S. - I work for [Etsy](http://etsy.com/) - a wonderful software company in Brooklyn. If you're interested in an internship or full time position with us, shoot me an email (vverma@etsy.com).
